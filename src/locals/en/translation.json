  "aboutUs.section1.p1": "What if building smarter, stronger, and greener homes was not just possible—but proven? Ecobuild is proud to lead that revolution in Israel and beyond. In response to a public call issued by the Government of Israel—an initiative led by then Minister of Finance Moshe Kahlon and Minister of Construction and Housing Yoav Galant—for the participation of innovative companies and entrepreneurs to help address the housing crisis in Israel, I took on the challenge and decided to embark on a personal and meaningful journey, driven by a national mission: to introduce a new, advanced, reliable, and efficient construction method that could transform the Israeli construction industry.",
  "aboutUs.section1.p2": "I embarked on a global search, visiting 8 countries and reviewing 11 advanced building systems. After extensive consultation with architects, contractors, and engineers, I found one solution that stood out: NUDURA ICF. Examining eleven different construction methods in depth, speaking with engineers, contractors, architects, and manufacturers, and learning the advantages, disadvantages, and adaptability of each method to Israel's climate, regulations, and construction culture. After thorough evaluations, one method stood out clearly in every parameter—the insulated concrete formwork (ICF) system by NUDURA from Canada.",
  "aboutUs.section1.whyNudura": "Why NUDURA?",
  "aboutUs.section1.p3": "The decision to choose NUDURA technology was complex and in-depth. I assessed every method from every possible angle—from production and transportation costs to ease and speed of installation, as well as long-term thermal and acoustic performance. I examined the suitability of each method for Israel's challenging climate, local regulatory limitations, and end-user expectations.",
  "aboutUs.section1.p4": "When I arrived at NUDURA's manufacturing facilities in Canada, I immediately understood that I had found the ideal solution to Israel's construction challenges. NUDURA combines rapid construction, military-grade durability, and energy savings of up to 72%—all in one system. Structural strength and durability, excellent thermal performance, and architectural flexibility—all at a competitive cost and with an exceptionally high level of reliability.",
  "aboutUs.section1.p5": "This led to the founding of Ecobuild and its establishment as the exclusive importer and distributor of NUDURA in Israel and additional countries. Since Ecobuild's founding, we have led hundreds of projects across the country—from private homes to public buildings and entire residential complexes. In every project, we see remarkable results: buildings that meet the world's most advanced green building standards, significant energy cost savings, exceptional climate comfort, and high user satisfaction.",

The competition celebrates environmentally friendly projects and products in the construction industry. Judge Dr. Kerry Ashford, CEO of the National Energy Foundation, explained the importance of the Greenbuild Competition. Journalist David Derbyshire moderated the event. “The Coralley House is an outstanding example of how energy-efficient architecture doesn't have to be constrained by design constraints or conventional thinking,” said designer Jake White of Ecotecture. “This elegant and contemporary home, which meets the family's design aspirations, is located within a national park in an area of outstanding natural beauty and uses very little fossil fuel and the national grid. It is the most complex design that Ecotecture architects have ever designed.”",

The transition from concrete to foam is seamless, and NUDURA's unique design allows the concrete to meet the exterior of the foam board. The DURA MULTILOCK Grid uses smaller connection points so that the grids are not visible on the concrete side of the wall.
